Maine Conservation Lands

What percentage of Maine's land is under conservation and who manages each piece?

Thoughts:

Create a visualization that shows:

Types of land that is conserved
The nonprofit/company that manages it
Privately held lands
Land usage
Marine protected areas?? Could use the dataset from https://marinecadastre.gov/ (see other folder)

only current visualization I could find of this is interactive:

something static might be more approachable for public use
