Maine Conservation Lands

FINAL GOAL:

A map of Maine land under conservation easement, color coded by who manages the parcel. When you roll over you would see the acreage and the name of the Trust.
Ultimately could be compared to a national map of conservation lands to see which states conserve the most land. 



USEFUL WEBSITES:

LIST OF MAINE LAND TRUSTS FROM MCHT:

http://www.mltn.org/view_trusts-alphabetical.php

Land conserved nationwide, all managers:

Shapefile of conserved lands: https://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/download/

Shapefiles (ecoregions) from the EPA: https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregion-download-files-state-region-1

What percentage of Maine's land is under conservation and who manages each piece?

THOUGHTS RANDOM & OTHERWISE:

Create a visualization that shows:

Types of land that is conserved
The nonprofit/company that manages it
Privately held lands
Land usage
Marine protected areas?? Could use the dataset from https://marinecadastre.gov/ (see other folder)

only current visualization I could find of this is interactive:

http://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/publications_maps/conservation_lands_maine.html

something static might be more approachable for public use. Plus everything about this is terrible. Zooming is the worst.



THOUGHTS ON THE STORY ITSELF:

What does land conservation mean? 
What are the different types/uses of conserved land?
