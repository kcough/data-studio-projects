landfills & wells

questions to answer re: groundwater contamination:


https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-08/documents/mgwc-gwc1.pdf

Just as ground water generally moves slowly, so
do contaminants in ground water. Because of this
slow movement, contaminants tend to remain
concentrated in the form of a plume (see Figure 1)
that flows along the same path as the ground
water. The size and speed of the plume depend on
the amount and type of contaminant, its solubility
and density, and the velocity of the surrounding
ground water. 
1. type of soil and how porous it is
 : contaminants mvoe faster through fractured rocks
2. household products & what they contain

"After further analysis, EPA estimated that for the
wells that contain pesticides, a significant percentage
probably contain chemical concentrations that
exceed the federal health-based limits (e.g., maximum
contaminant levels or health advisory levels).
Approximately 14.6 percent of the wells tested
contained levels of one or more pesticides above
the minimum reporting limit set in the survey."

Questions to ask Roger Crouse:

How close is too close to a landfill?
How many years until a closed landfill is 'safe'?
How many closed landfills in Maine have been treated for leachate?
What are the regulations in place for well water?
How often do people test?


Nitrate/nitrite tests cost $30-50 a year; tests for arsenic, lead, etc. cost between $70-100 every five years
