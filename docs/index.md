# Hi, I'm Kate.

This is my site of projects for the [Lede Program](http://ledeprogram.com)

* [Surviving the Titanic]({{ site.url }}/titanic): Passengers paying higher fares were less likely to perish.
* [Worldwide Nuclear Testing Since 1945]({{ site.url }}/nuclear): US conducts lots of smaller tests, while China and Russia favor fewer ones with bigger bangs
* [Land Conservation in Maine]({{ site.url }}/conservation): Maine is a nationwide leader in land conservation-but most of Maine's conserved land is private.
*[The Chemicals in Your Raincoat...and Your Potatoes]({{ site.url }}/landfills): Toxins that make Gore-Tex water-resistant and Teflon non-stick have been linked to slew of serious health issues. Are they in Maine's wells?
