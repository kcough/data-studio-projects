# Many Maine landfills have high levels of lead, arsenic and lack testing for emerging contaminants

**Mainers rely heavily on drinking water from private wells.** In some areas of the state upwards of 70 percent of the population gets water from a well. 

**The state does not require testing for private wells,** but suggests testing yearly for bacteria and nitrates and every 3 to 5 years for arsenic, fluoride, uranium, radon, lead, and manganese. The yearly tests run $40, on average, and the others run between $70-100.
