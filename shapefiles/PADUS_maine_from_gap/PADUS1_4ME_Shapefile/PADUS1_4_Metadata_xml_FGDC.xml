			<abstract>The USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is the nation's inventory of protected areas, including public open space and voluntarily provided, private protected areas, identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastral Theme (http://www.fgdc.gov/ngda-reports/NGDA_Datasets.html).  PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means.  The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas.  Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included.  The PAD-US database strives to be a complete “best available” inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state.  For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners.  As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas.
The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services and analyses: Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Fee, Easements and Combined.  The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System.  The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED, Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory).  The "Combined" feature class integrates all fee, easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework.  
In addition to geographic boundaries, PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee, easement, designation, other), owner and managing agency, designation type, unit name, area, public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields.  An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source, GIS Source, GIS Source Date) and "local" or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources.  The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity: the nationally relevant "GAP Status Code" and global "IUCN Category" standard.
A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local, regional, state, national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.)
Due to the completeness and complexity of these data, it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints, to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for. For more information regarding the PAD-US dataset please visit, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/. To find more data resources as well as view example analysis performed using PAD-US data visit, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/resources/. The PAD-US dataset and data standard are compiled and maintained by the USGS Gap Analysis Program, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/ . For more information about data standards and how the data are aggregated please review the “Standards and Methods Manual for PAD-US,” http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/standards/ .</abstract>
			<purpose>Purpose: The mission of the USGS Gap Analysis Program (GAP) is providing state, regional and national assessments of the conservation status of native vertebrate species and natural land cover types and facilitating the application of this information to land management activities. The PAD-US geodatabase is required to organize and assess the management status (i.e. apply GAP Status Codes) of elements of biodiversity protection.  The goal of GAP is to 'keep common species common' by identifying species and plant communities not adequately represented in existing conservation lands. Common species are those not currently threatened with extinction. By identifying their habitats, gap analysis gives land managers and policy makers the information they need to make better-informed decisions when identifying priority areas for conservation.  In cooperation with UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre, GAP ensures PAD-US also supports global analyses to inform policy decisions by maintaining World Database for Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes and data for International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categorized protected areas in the United States.  GAP seeks to increase the efficiency and accuracy of PAD-US updates by leveraging resources in protected areas data aggregation and maintenance as described in "A Map of the Future", published following the PAD-US Design Project (July, 2009) available at: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/vision/ with updates coming soon.  While PAD-US was originally developed to support the GAP Mission stated above, the dataset is robust and has been expanded to support the conservation, recreation and public health communities as well.  Additional applications become apparent over time.  See the GAP Website http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/resources/ or the companion site http://protectedlands.net/uses for more information.</purpose>
			<supplinf>As mentioned in the Abstract section of this metadata record, the PAD-US database strives to be a complete “best available” inventory of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. This includes both fee ownership of lands as well as management through leases, easements or other binding agreements. The data also tracks designations identified in management plans (i.e. BLM Area of Environmental Concern) or other internal management designations (e.g. Inventoried Roadless Areas). All of these factors provide for a robust yet complex dataset. It is important to have in mind a specific analysis question, when approaching how to work with the data.
As a full inventory of protected areas by name and management designation, aggregated from authoritative source data, PAD-US includes legitimately overlapping designation types and sliver errors.  Overlapping designations largely occur in the federal theme of the "fee" or "combined" feature classes (e.g. Wilderness Area over a Wild and Scenic River and National Forest), these are important to note especially when trying to calculate overall area statistics, as these overlaps can count the same area of ground multiple times.  Many overlaps may be removed from the federal theme by selecting where "Category" = 'Designation'.  Otherwise a specific data query should be performed or rasterization on a priority field before tallying area from the raw database. Area stats are available from the PAD-US website: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/statistics/. As the PAD-US database is a direct aggregation of source data, the PAD-US development team does not alter the spatial linework in anyway, except to “clip” the data along State boundary lines using the official PAD-US state boundary file provided by Census. For both of these reasons some data silvers occur in the dataset. There are many overlapping edge slivers between source datasets and some slivers that are created by the state boundary file. Major sliver and data overlap errors have been identified and shared with agency data stewards for correction in source files that will then be incorporated in subsequent PAD-US versions over time.  
Boundaries containing overlapping federal management designations can be selected using a query of the data where "Category" = Designation. This will select the areas that are management designations, that can either be analyzed by designation type, or removed from the data to reduce overlap.  GAP intends to identify additional overlapping designations managed by state and other agencies in the next PAD-US update.  GAP conducts separate analyses to summarize area statistics for PAD-US attributes such as: Owner Name, Manager Name, GAP Status Code, IUCN Category, and State Name.  GAP also provides select data from PAD-US for the USGS National Map (http://nationalmap.gov/).  Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for more information before conducting area related analyses.
IUCN Categorized protected areas are sent following PAD-US updates to global partners managing the North American PAD (http://CEC.org ) and World Database for Protected Areas (WDPA, http://protectedplanet.net ).  See the PAD-US Data Standard at: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/standards/ or contact the PAD-US Coordinator for more information.

		<accconst>These data are in the public domain.
The PAD-US version 1.4 data was developed using an ESRI ArcGIS version 10 File Geodatabase format. This is done to be able to utilize the expanded data capabilities of the File Geodatabase for overall size, attribute name length, attribute aliases, and coded domain values. To follow open data standards and to make the data available for the broadest audience of data users the data will also be made available for download in shapefile (.shp) and ArcGIS version 9.x file geodatabase formats. http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/download/  Other data formats and data scales not immediately available for download on the PAD-US download website may be obtained by contacting the PAD-US development team. http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/contacts/</accconst>
		<useconst>It is strongly recommended that these data are directly acquired from the U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program website and server (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/ ), and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way. It is also strongly recommended that careful attention be paid to the contents of the metadata file associated with these data (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/metadata/ ). The U.S. Geological Survey and all contributing data partners and aggregators shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein.
All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that PAD-US will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that question.  Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for guidance.  While it is impossible to predict all the uses of these data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's perspective. 
Use constraints: 
Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as the nation, a region or state (completeness in counties varies) or to provide context for finer-level maps. A general list of possible applications includes:
-National, regional or statewide biodiversity planning, research, management, or policy making
-National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning, research, management, or policy making
-Outdoor recreation planning, research, management or policy making
-Public health planning, research, management or policy making
-County comprehensive planning
-Large-area resource management planning
-Coarse-filter evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals, regional open space and recreation proposals, etc.
-Determining relative amounts of management responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards to facilitate cooperative management and planning.
-Basic research on regional distributions of plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas for needed research.
-Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military activities.
-Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based activities.
-Education at all levels and for both students and citizens.
Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however, there is a "fuzzy line" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include:
-Using the data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys in areas where data are incomplete.
-Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps or answer queries.
-Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares 
-Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition.
-Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact geographic area
-Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature.
-Establishing a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data.
-Altering the data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product.
-Using the data without acquiring and reviewing the metadata.</useconst>

This PAD-US Version 1.4 dataset includes a variety of updates from the previous version 1.3 dataset. The following list includes the major updates.
1) Complete update of federal lands theme including the following agencies: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department of Defense (DOD), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) land were transferred from PAD-US 1.3 as best available nationally aggregated data.
The federal lands update was developed in collaboration with the FGDC Federal Lands Working Group (https://cms.geoplatform.gov/a16govunits/FederalLands) including lands administered under fee title (e.g. National Forest, National Park, National Wildlife Refuge), congressional designations (e.g. Wilderness, Wild and Scenic River), Presidential proclamations (e.g. National Monuments), administrative protected areas (e.g. BLM ACECs) and conservation easements.  Proclamation boundaries are available but are not integrated into PAD-US to reduce overlaps.  Documentation tracking the translation of source data into the PAD-US schema is available; contact the PAD-US website or PAD-US Coordinator for more information.
2) 20 PAD-US State Data Steward Network updates to state, local government and / or private protected areas in: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wyoming).  Information regarding state stewards at: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/ and http://protectedlands.net/partners.
3) New local government (i.e. county, city) protected areas in 13 states across the country, aggregated by the Trust for Public Land (TPL, http://tpl.org ) for their Conservation Almanac that tracks the conservation finance movement across the country.
4) TNC Lands, national update of lands owned or managed by The Nature Conservancy (TNC, http://maps.tnc.org ).  
5) Miscellaneous edits (e.g. Wisconsin County Forests).
6) Integration of non-sensitive easements, suitable for publication in the public domain, from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) provided by NCED Partners (Duck's Unlimited and TPL).
7) National Marine Protected Areas (MPA) from the NOAA MPA Inventory identified as "member" or "eligible" by NOAA for the National System of Marine Protected Areas (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ). 
8) Categorical conservation measures assignment reviews by NPS, FWS, BLM, USFS, NOAA.
9) Significantly revised "Designation Type" standard including several new domains.  See the GAP Website to download the PAD-US Data Standard for more details (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/standards/ ).
10) New "Manager Type" and "Manager Name" fields to complement "Owner Name", "Owner Type" and source data (i.e. Local Owner, Local Manager), populated by an Agency Name standard reviewed by the FGDC Federal Lands Working Group.
11) Additional "Date of Establishment" (DOE) records to track the year an area was designated or otherwise protected, provided by PAD-US State Data Stewards and federal partners.  This field is not fully attributed; please contact the PAD-US Coordinator to provide additional dates.
12) Additional "Public Access" reviews by select PAD-US Data Stewards and federal partners.  Access generally describes (i.e. Open, Closed, Restricted, Unknown) the public's access to protected areas as defined by data stewards for particular units or categorical assignments by Designation Type.  
13) The transfer of locally reviewed GAP Status Codes, IUCN Categories, Public Access and DOE from PAD-US version 1.3.
See the PAD-US companion site (http://protectedlands.net ) for maps of capacity and data completeness by state.  Significant improvements to the local government theme are under way in partnership with the Trust for Public Land (TPL).</complete>

				<procdesc>Compilation and aggregation of the PAD-US database is a complicated and lengthy process, the final database includes data from thousands of data sources and many data aggregators. Data development and aggregation are an ongoing and evolving process. The data schema and development standards have changed with each version to better reflect source data as well as analysis needs; the database also strives to maintain a complete set of both standardized as well as local attributes and source data types, to ensure a complete raw database that can be used for a variety of application and analysis. The PAD-US development team works closely with a large variety of stakeholders including development partners, data sources, and data users to develop and maintain the "Standards and Methods Manual for PAD-US document, available online, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/standards/ with updates regarding PAD-US 1.4 expected late 2016. The standards document outlines the data type, format and schema required for all source datasets, it also includes a checklist of the major components that each source file needs to contain. The PAD-US development team uses a Python script to generate a QA/QC report based on the items on this checklist, that is run each time a source file is submitted, this way the PAD-US team can work with sources to ensure that data submissions meet data standards. Subsequent process steps will outline the general workflow and processes used to compile each major component of the final database.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>The USGS Gap Analysis Program and PAD-US development team have worked to create a “State Data Steward” network with a major data contact in each state that can provide a data update of state, local, NGO, and Private Lands within their respective state. More information about the “State Data Steward Network” can be found on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/ as well as the PAD-US companion site (http://protectedlands.net/partners ) that includes maps of data management capacity, estimated inventory completeness and a table of contacts by state.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>The individual state files are combined together and then incorporated into datasets that the PAD-US development team compiles at a national scale. These include all federal lands that are aggregated through the FGDC Federal Lands Working Group (http://www.fgdc.gov/participation/working-groups-subcommittees/cadastral/fed-lands-wg-membership, transitioning to https://cms.geoplatform.gov/a16govunits/FederalLands).  The working group contains representatives from the federal agencies that either provided data directly or worked together to designate an authoritative best available source of their agency data. This update included lands for the following agencies: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department of Defense (DOD), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) land were transferred from PAD-US 1.3 as best available nationally aggregated data.
Other nationally aggregated data files include easements from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED), a national update of Nature Conservancy Lands (TNC), and a 13 state update of local government lands new to PAD-US from The Trust for Public Land (TPL) as a method to complete the inventory .</procdesc>

				<procdesc>After datasets are submitted to the PAD-US team they are reconciled with previous versions of PAD-US to transfer any locally assigned GAP Status Codes, IUCN Categories, Access, and Date of Establishment values, that weren’t assigned or updated in the data update. After transferring these locally assigned values, the remaining GAP Status, IUCN Categories, and Access values that weren’t locally assigned in the data update are then categorically assigned using a Python script based on the categorical assignment tables in the PAD-US standards manual. The PAD-US team also reconciles, incorporates, and maintains the WDPA ID, needed to submit data to the World Database for Protected Areas.</procdesc>
				<procdate>Unknown</procdate>

				<procdesc>After compiling all data together the data is checked for completeness of required attributes and that all domains and standardized field attributes are completely assigned. In the absence of other information (e.g. local assignment or review) of "GAP Status Code", "IUCN Category" and "Public Access" are assigned categorically based on "Designation Type" as described in tables in the standards manual.</procdesc>
				<procdate>Unknown</procdate>

				<procdesc>After official USGS data publication, the data is made available for download from the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/download/ , in various scales and data formats. The data is available in ESRI File Geodatabase format, both versions 9.x and 10.x as well as shapefile format.

'Other' types of protection include leases, agreements or those over marine waters.  'Designation' is applied to designations in the federal theme not tied to title documents (e.g. National Monument, Wild and Scenic River).

				<attrlabl>GAP_Sts</attrlabl>
				<attrdef>The GAP Status Code is a measure of management intent to conserve biodiversity defined as: Status 1: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a natural state within which disturbance events (of natural type, frequency, intensity, and legacy) are allowed to proceed without interference or are mimicked through management.  Status 2: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a primarily natural state, but which may receive uses or management practices that degrade the quality of existing natural communities, including suppression of natural disturbance.  Status 3: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover for the majority of the area, but subject to extractive uses of either a broad, low-intensity type (e.g., logging, OHV recreation) or localized intense type (e.g., mining). It also confers protection to federally listed endangered and threatened species throughout the area.  Status 4: There are no known public or private institutional mandates or legally recognized easements or deed restrictions held by the managing entity to prevent conversion of natural habitat types to anthropogenic habitat types. The area generally allows conversion to unnatural land cover throughout or management intent is unknown.  See the PAD-US Standards Manual for a summary of methods or the geodatabase look up table for short descriptions.</attrdef>

				<attrlabl>IUCN_Cat</attrlabl>
				<attrdef>International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) management categories assigned to protected areas for inclusion in the UNEP- World Conservation Monitoring Center's (WCMC) World Database for Protected Areas (WDPA) and the Commission for Environmental Cooperation's (CEC) North American Terrestrial Protected Areas Database.  IUCN defines a protected area as, "A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values" (includes GAP Status Code 1 and 2 only). Categorization follows as:  Category Ia: Strict Nature Reserves are strictly protected areas set aside to protect biodiversity and also possibly geological / geomorphological features, where human visitation, use and impacts are strictly controlled and limited to ensure preservation of the conservation values.  Such protected areas can serve as indispensable reference areas for scientific research and monitoring.  Category Ib: Wilderness Areas are protected areas are usually large unmodified or slightly modified areas, retaining their natural character and influence, without permanent or significant human habitation, which are protected and managed so as to preserve their natural condition.  Category II: National Park protected areas are large natural or near natural areas set aside to protect large-scale ecological processes, along with the complement of species and ecosystems characteristic of the area, which also provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities.  Category III: Natural Monument or Feature protected areas are set aside to protect a specific natural monument, which can be a land form, sea mount, submarine caverns, geological feature such as caves or even a living feature such as an ancient grove.  They are generally quite small protected areas and often have high visitor value.  Category  IV: Habitat/species management protected areas aim to protect particular species or habitats and management reflects this priority.  Many category IV protected areas will need regular, active interventions to address the requirements of particular species or to maintain habitats, but this is not a requirement of this category.  Category V: Protected landscape/seascape protected areas occur where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value.  Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use (community based, non industrial) of natural resources are generally large, with much of the area in a more-or-less natural condition and whereas a proportion is under sustainable natural resource management and where such exploitation is seen as one of the main aims of the area.  "Other Conservation Areas" are not recognized by IUCN at this time; however, they are included in the CEC's database referenced above.  These areas (includes GAP Status Code 3 only)are included in the IUCN Category Domain along with "Unassigned" areas (includes GAP Status Code 4) and "Not Reported" areas that meet the definition of IUCN protection (i.e. GAP Status Code 1 or 2) but where IUCN Category has not yet been assigned and categorical assignment is not appropriate.
